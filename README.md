## Definitions
- Gene Primer: 
- Gene Probe: 
- genomic sequencing: A laboratory method that is used to determine the entire genetic makeup of a specific organism or cell type. This method can be used to find changes in areas of the genome.
- mat(ure) peptide or protein coding sequence: coding sequence for the mature or final peptide or protein product following post-translational modification; the location does not include the stop codon (unlike the corresponding CDS).
- Post-translational modification: Covalent and generally enzymatic modification of proteins following protein biosynthesis.
- CDS: 
- Biosynthesis: the generation of natural products through enzymatic reactions, as in cellular metabolism.
